- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThanapongR
- 👀 I love programming, problem-solving, circuit design, and smart home systems. Creating something from code is satisfying, while complex problems invigorate me. Circuit design lets me innovate, while smart homes excite me with automation. Developing apps, circuits, or smart home systems fulfills me when my ideas make a difference.
- 🌱 I'm interested in technology related to app development, web design, and cloud computing.
